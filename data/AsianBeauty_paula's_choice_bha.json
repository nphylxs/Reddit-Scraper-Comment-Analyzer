Also, the formulas are close to the PC one, as they uses propanediol as base too and they are similar in consistency as well.  Generally speaking, most korean products either have 0,5% BHA in them at max, or if they have more, than some other form of BHA is added, which is usually not that effective. This is due to a korean regularion, which says that cosmetic products can have max 0,5 percent of salicylic acid in them.
