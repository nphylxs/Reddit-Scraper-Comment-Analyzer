Which actually makes sense, since on the Skin1004 their ingredient list states \"Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil\".\n\nIf you're looking for a perfume, you could try [this search](https://www.fragrantica.com/ingredients-search/), where you can add or exclude certain components!\n\n[Full INCIs here](https://skin1004.com/products/skin1004-madagascar-centella-light-cleansing-oil), but I personally only smell the bergamot.",
